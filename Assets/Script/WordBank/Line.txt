Are you <v> by how <adj> it is?
When I think of <n>, I <v>.
Does the <n> make you <adj>?
The <n> is not <adj>!
The <n> is <adj>!
How <adj> is the <adj>, <adj> <n>!
Never <v> the <n> and the <adj> <n>.
Oh!
I will be your <n>.
And...
You will miss that <adj> <n>.
But <n> is what <n> need.
Break <n>.
Free <n>.
<v>.
Just <v>.
It's just a <n>.
But you, you are so <adj>.
How can I <v>, how can I <v>.
Oh, <n>, I feel so <adj>.
I know <n>.
I'm <verb> out the <n>.
When I was a <n>.
My <n> told me don't <v>.
When you grow up,
Would you be the <n> of the <n>.
He said, "<v>".
She's <v> me.
Long Ago, I give up <v>ing
Just like the <n> you die in.
I've been <v> for too long.
You cannot <v> me.
You have to <v> me.
The <adj> leader will never know.
Let's kill the <n>.
Let him kill the <n>.
In the middle of <n>.
In the center of <n>.
They say, <v>.
I'm like a <adj> <n>.
You are the <adj> <n> of this life.
So am I still <v>ing?
Can't find a <n>.
Let break <n> down.
This government need to be <v>.
This world is <adj>.
The world is a <n>.
Let's run away.
"Where can you <v>"
<n> with <n>.
It was a <adj> night.
He say it's the <n> of the nation.
<n> is in pain.
<n> is starving.
<n> is killing the people.
I saw my future <n>.
I saw the <n> of this country.
But you don't <v> anything.
Then I gave my <n>.
Although I, <v>.
They told us not to <v>.
Don't say that word, <n>.
Don't say that word, <adj>.
shh, you need to be <adj>.
Please, don't <v>. It will hurt you.
The problem is <n>.
Will you <v> with me?
No!
How long do we need to suffer to see <n>.
How to end this <n>.
