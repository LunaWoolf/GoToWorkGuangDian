Are you <v> by how <adj> it is?
When I think of <n>, I <v>.
Does the <n> make you <adj>?
The <n> is not <adj>!
The <n> is <adj>!
How <adj> is the <adj>, <adj> <n>!
Never <v> the <n> and the <adj> <n>.
Oh!
I will be your <n>.
And,
You will miss that <adj> <n>.
But <n> is what <n> need.
Break <n>.
Free <n>.
<v>.
Just <v>.
It's just a <n>.
But you, you are so <adj>.
How can I <v>, how can I <v>.
